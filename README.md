# DevChallenges-Journey

Welcome to the **DevChallenges-Journey**! This repository is dedicated to my ongoing coding practice, where I solve challenges from various platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, and others.

## Structure

The repository is organized by platforms, and within each platform, you'll find individual challenges with their problem statements and solutions.

- **HackerRank/**: Contains solutions to challenges from HackerRank.
- **LeetCode/**: Contains solutions to challenges from LeetCode.
- **OtherPlatforms/**: Contains solutions to challenges from other coding platforms.

Each challenge is in its own folder, with the following structure:

- `problem_statement.md`: A markdown file describing the challenge.
- `solution.py`: The Python code that solves the challenge.

## Coding Commitment

My goal is to regularly solve coding challenges and commit the solutions to this repository. I'll try my best to maintain consistency, but the frequency may vary depending on other commitments.

## Contributions

Feel free to fork this repository and try solving these challenges on your own. If you find any errors or have suggestions, open an issue or a pull request.

## Contact

If you want to discuss any of the solutions or have any questions, feel free to reach out!

Happy Coding!
